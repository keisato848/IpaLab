The image provided is the **Statement of Intent (出題趣旨)** for the essay portion (午後 II) of the Project Manager Examination, which outlines the topics for the two long-form questions (問1 and 問2).

This document does not contain the multiple-choice questions or the corresponding answer key (mapping 問X to ア, イ, ウ, エ) required to generate the JSON output.

Therefore, I cannot extract the list of correct answers from this specific image. If you provide an image of the actual answer key (which typically lists 80 answers for the morning and afternoon I sections), I can complete the request.
